## Conservation International: Protecting the Planet and All Its Inhabitants

**Conservation International is a non-profit organization that is committed to protecting the planet and all its inhabitants by promoting, facilitating, and supporting conservation practices. This global charity has been working diligently to protect natural resources, preserve biodiversity, and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change since 1987.**

## What Does Conservation International Do?

Conservation International aims to tackle a wide range of environmental issues, including climate change, healthy ecosystems, land-use change, sustainable agriculture, and oceanic conservation. Through their work, they help protect nearly 6,000 species across 77 different countries.

One of Conservation International's missions is **to preserve and promote sustainable land use to reduce deforestation, carbon emissions, and promote resilient ecosystems that benefit nature, people, and our planet**. They also work on policies and strategies to combat climate change.

Another program that Conservation International runs is their efforts in **marine conservation** \- this is critical because nearly half of the world's population relies on the ocean for their food source\, and oceanic ecosystems drive the world's climate and weather patterns\. They promote approaches for responsible fishing\, effective management of marine protected areas\, and restoration of critical marine habitats\.

They also work hand in hand with communities and indigenous peoples **to provide sustainable and ecosystem-based livelihoods** that align with nature's limits, and ensure they benefit equitably.

Conservation International also runs several conservation programs to help raise public awareness and implement sustainable practices at the local level. This includes a range of initiatives such as the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, Nature for Climate, and the Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities Portal.

## How Does Conservation International Do It?

Conservation International works with partners from all sectors of society, including governments, NGOs, communities, corporations, and donors. Some of the ways that Conservation International undertakes its conservation programs include:

* To build strong partnerships with a diverse range of stakeholders for improved outcomes.

* Developing conservation plans based on scientific research

* Providing support for sustainable livelihoods that also promote conservation efforts
