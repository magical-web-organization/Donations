## Earthjustice’s mission

Earthjustice’s mission is to safeguard the environment and protect endangered species by using the law as a tool to ensure that all people have access to clean air, water, and a healthy environment. The organization has been involved in numerous landmark cases that have helped shape U.S. environmental law and policy over the years.

## How Earthjustice promotes environmental justice

Environmental justice is the effort to ensure that people of all races, nationalities, and income levels are treated equitably when it comes to environmental issues. Earthjustice works to make sure that no community is left behind in the fight for a healthy environment.
