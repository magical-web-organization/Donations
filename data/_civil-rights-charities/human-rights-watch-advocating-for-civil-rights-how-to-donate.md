**Human Rights Watch is an independent, non-profit organization that aims to protect and promote human rights around the world. They work tirelessly to expose human rights abuses, hold governments and other organizations accountable, and provide support to those who have had their rights violated.**

## What Does Human Rights Watch Do to Help with Civil Rights?

Human Rights Watch works on a broad range of issues related to civil rights, including:

* Racial justice
* Women's rights
* LGBT rights
* Children's rights
* Freedom of speech and expression
* Right to a fair trial

They conduct research, publish reports, and engage in advocacy and public education to advance these issues.

One of the primary ways they make a difference is by shining a light on human rights abuses that might not otherwise receive attention. They send researchers into the field to investigate allegations of abuses, then publicize their findings to the media, policymakers, and the general public.

In addition to raising awareness of specific cases of abuse, Human Rights Watch works to address systemic issues that contribute to human rights violations. They advocate for legal reform, improved enforcement of existing laws, and increased protections for vulnerable populations.

## How Does Human Rights Watch Do It?

Human Rights Watch employs a variety of strategies to achieve their goals. These include:

* **Investigative research**: Their researchers conduct investigations into human rights abuses around the world, often traveling to conflict zones or other dangerous areas to gather information.
* **Advocacy**: They engage in advocacy efforts with governments, international organizations, and other influential groups to push for reform and better protections for human rights.
* **Litigation**: They use the legal system to challenge human rights abuses and hold public officials accountable for their actions.
* Public education: They use media attention and public education campaigns to raise awareness of human rights issues and motivate people to take action.
