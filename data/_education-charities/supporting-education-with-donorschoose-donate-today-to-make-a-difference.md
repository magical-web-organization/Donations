Education is one of the foundation stones of society, and yet it is underfunded, especially in public schools. To help solve this problem, DonorsChoose has been working tirelessly to make education accessible to every student in America. DonorsChoose helps to bring much-needed funding to public schools in America through charitable donations.

## What is DonorsChoose?

DonorsChoose is a non-profit organization that connects donors with public school teachers to help fund classroom projects. The organization was founded in 2000 by a public school teacher named Charles Best. DonorsChoose makes it easy for individuals and corporations to provide direct assistance to classrooms in need.

## How Does DonorsChoose Work?

DonorsChoose works by allowing teachers to create project proposals for their classrooms. These proposals outline what the teacher needs and how much it will cost. Once a project is approved, it is published on the DonorsChoose website, where donors can search for projects they want to fund. Donations can be as little as $1, and 100% of all donations go toward funding the project.

Once a project is fully funded, DonorsChoose purchases the materials for the teacher and sends them directly to the classroom. Teachers then post pictures of their students using the materials, and donors receive an update on the project's impact.

## How Does DonorsChoose Help Education?

DonorsChoose helps to bridge the funding gap in public school classrooms **by providing necessary materials and resources that would not otherwise be available**. Teachers use the materials purchased with DonorsChoose donations to create engaging learning experiences for their students. This can include anything from books and art supplies to technology equipment and field trips.

DonorsChoose also helps to support the fundamental pillars of education, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Through DonorsChoose, donors can fund projects that introduce students to coding, robotics, and other technology-based fields.

## How Can I Donate to DonorsChoose?

Donating to DonorsChoose is easy! Simply visit the [DonorsChoose ](https://www.donorschoose.org/)website and browse through the projects. Once you find a project that you want to fund, you can make a donation using your credit card. DonorsChoose is a qualified 501(c)(3) charity, so your donation is tax-deductible.

DonorsChoose also accepts gift cards from retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy, and you can even donate cryptocurrency. Corporate donors can also contribute to DonorsChoose by sponsoring a specific project or donating gift cards.

## Conclusion

**DonorsChoose is an incredible organization that is making a difference in the lives of students and teachers across America. By providing access to necessary materials and resources, DonorsChoose is helping to level the playing field in public schools. With your help, DonorsChoose can continue to make a difference and create a brighter future for students.**
