**Pencils of Promise (PoP) is a nonprofit organization that believes every child deserves access to quality education.

## How Does Pencils of Promise Help with Education?

### Building Schools

PoP's primary mission is to build schools in areas where education is not easily accessible.

PoP designs and constructs schools that meet the needs of the communities they serve. They focus primarily on building sustainable structures that are safe, secure, and meet local building standards.

### Teacher Support

Building schools is only part of the equation. PoP's focus is on education, and that means supporting the teachers who are instrumental in delivering lessons to students. The charity provides teachers with professional development opportunities, resources, and training. The teachers are vetted and must meet PoP's standards to teach in their schools.

### Educational Programs

PoP utilizes a holistic approach to education by providing students with resources that go beyond the classroom. These programs include:

* **WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) program**: Clean water and sanitation facilities are essential for maintaining good health. PoP provides these facilities to help keep children healthy and in school.
* **Girls' Education Program**: PoP believes in equal access to education. This program aims to get more girls into classrooms and keep them there, where they can learn and grow.
* **In-School Programs**: These topics include health, nutrition, and environmental science and are designed to provide students with a well-rounded education.
