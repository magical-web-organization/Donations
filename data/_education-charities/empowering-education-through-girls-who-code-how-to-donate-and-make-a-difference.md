**Girls Who Code (GWC) is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2012 with the mission of closing the gender gap in technology. They aim to empower and equip young girls with the necessary skills, resources and support to succeed in tech-related fields like computer science, coding, and engineering.**

## What Girls Who Code does?

GWC offers several programs that serve girls in elementary school all the way through college. They believe that early exposure to coding can spark an interest in technology that may turn into a lifelong passion or even a career. Here are some of the programs and initiatives they offer:

### 1\. Clubs

Clubs are designed for girls in grades 3-12, and they meet after school and on weekends. They offer a supportive, fun and engaging environment where girls can learn to code, work on projects, and build their skills alongside peers who share their interests.

### 2\. Summer Immersion Program

The Summer Immersion Program is a 7-week course that is designed for girls in 10th and 11th grade. It is an intensive program that exposes girls to computer science concepts, programming languages, and real-world applications of technology.

### 3\. College Loops

College Loops are designed for girls in college. The program offers mentorship and support to college-aged girls who are interested in pursuing careers in technology. It gives them access to a community of like-minded individuals and connects them with mentors who can offer guidance and advice.

### 4\. International Girls Who Code Day

International Girls Who Code Day is an annual event that takes place on the first Saturday in October. Girls from all over the world come together to celebrate and participate in coding activities and projects. This event helps to build a sense of community and encourages girls to pursue coding and technology-related interests.
