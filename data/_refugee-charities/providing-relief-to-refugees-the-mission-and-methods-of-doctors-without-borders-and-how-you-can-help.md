**Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), is an international humanitarian organization that provides emergency medical aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters, and exclusion from healthcare in over 70 countries. One of the key areas of focus for MSF is providing medical care to refugees who have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict or persecution.**

## What Does Doctors Without Borders Do to Help Refugees?

Doctors Without Borders provides medical and humanitarian assistance to refugees in multiple ways:

### Emergency Medical Care

As refugees flee their homes, they may face danger, injury or disease. Providing access to medical care saves lives and helps prevent needless suffering.

### Vaccinations

Many refugees, especially children, have inadequate access to standard vaccination schedules. Doctors Without Borders takes responsibility for administering vaccinations to all refugees that the organisation works with.

### Mental Health Services

Refugees can experience significant levels of trauma, anxiety and depression due to the violent circumstances they have experienced. Doctors Without Borders provides targeted mental health support for refugees to help them begin their road to recovery.

### Safe Water and Sanitation Systems

In many conflict-ridden areas, access to clean water and adequate sanitation systems can be difficult. Doctors Without Borders creates reliable access to safe water and proper sanitary facilities.

### Long-Term Support and Rehabilitation

Doctors Without Borders remains committed to providing long-term support and rehabilitation to refugees beyond providing initial care.

## How Does Doctors Without Borders Help Refugees?

Doctors Without Borders helps refugees in multiple ways:

### On-The-Ground Support

Doctors Without Borders' teams work hands-on to provide quality medical care and humanitarian aid.

### Training and Education

Doctors Without Borders provides a wide variety of training and education services to community leaders and health workers, who remain after the organisation's work concludes.

### Advocacy

Doctors Without Borders also advocates for the rights of refugees and on the larger socio-political environment that refugees occupy.
