Save the Children is a global organization that works to improve the lives of children around the world. One of their primary areas of focus is providing aid and assistance to refugees. They have been working with and supporting refugees for over 100 years.

## What does Save the Children do to help refugees?

Save the Children provides a range of services to refugees, including:

### 1\. Emergency assistance

When refugees are displaced, they often have nothing but the clothes on their backs. Save the Children provides emergency assistance in the form of shelter, food, water, and medical care. They also provide child-friendly spaces where children can play, learn, and receive support.

### 2\. Education

Many refugee children are unable to attend school due to their displacement. Save the Children works to provide education to these children, often in the form of informal learning environments like temporary schools and child-friendly spaces. They also provide vocational training and job placement services to older refugees.

### 3\. Protection

Save the Children works to protect refugee children from exploitation, abuse, and neglect. They provide child protection services and work to reunite separated families.
