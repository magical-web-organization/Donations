## Introduction

Around the world, millions of people are displaced from their homes and communities due to conflict, persecution or other human rights violations. They are forced to leave everything behind and face uncertain futures. In order to alleviate their suffering, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides critical assistance and protection to refugees and other displaced persons. In this article, we will dive deeper into the work of UNHCR, how it helps refugees, and how you can donate to support its mission.

## What is UNHCR?

**The UNHCR is an international organization that works to protect and support refugees, asylum-seekers, and stateless people worldwide.

## What Does UNHCR Do to Help Refugees?

The UNHCR provides a range of services to refugees, which include:

The UNHCR works to ensure that refugees are protected and their rights are respected. It provides refugees with legal assistance, particularly with regards to their right to seek asylum. Moreover, it works to prevent and address issues such as forced return and detention of refugees, and the separation of families.

### 2\. Shelter and Basic Necessities

UNHCR provides refugees with emergency shelter and other basic necessities such as food, blankets, clothes, and clean water. It also helps in building durable solutions for the refugees to help them safely return home or settle in a new area.

They work with local health institutions to provide a range of services including basic healthcare, reproductive, and maternal healthcare, mental and psychological support, and counselling.

In some countries, it also runs cash assistance and micro-credit programs, partnering with local industries or entrepreneurs to create small businesses that refugees can own or operate.
