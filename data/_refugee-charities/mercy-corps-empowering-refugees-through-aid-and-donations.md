## Introduction

**Mercy Corps is an international humanitarian organization that works in more than 40 countries around the world. The organization is known for its work in emergency response, post disaster reconstruction, and development. One of the most important missions of Mercy Corps is to assist refugees and displaced people by providing them with essential services and opportunities to rebuild their lives.**

## The Challenges of Refugees

The experience of being forced to flee one's home is a traumatic one that often results in the separation from family members, loss of personal belongings, and the need for immediate access to food, shelter and healthcare. Displacement is often a long-term problem, and refugees typically face difficulties with resettlement, social inclusion, and integration into their new communities.

Mercy Corps works to ensure that refugees have access to essential services and that the basic needs of refugees are met as quickly as possible. Mercy Corps does more than just provide food and shelter: it works hard to restore hope, dignity, and self-reliance to refugees, empowering them with the tools and resources necessary to rebuild their lives.

## How Mercy Corps Helps Refugees

### 1\. Emergency Response and Relief Distribution

As soon as a crisis unfolds, Mercy Corps is quick to respond by providing immediate emergency assistance to those affected. This assistance may include the provision of food, water, shelter, emergency medical care, and hygiene kits to prevent the spread of disease.

### 2\. Educational Opportunities

Mercy Corps also provides educational opportunities for refugees, including by establishing schools and organizing e-learning programs. Education helps to provide hope to refugees by giving them the necessary tools and resources to navigate their new surroundings, and to rebuild their lives.

### 3\. Livelihood Programs

In addition, Mercy Corps provides livelihood programs to help refugees start new businesses, gain new skills, and connect with job opportunities. This empowers refugees with a sense of self-determination and the ability to build a new life.

### 4\. Psychosocial Support

Mercy Corps offers individual and group counseling, as well as psychosocial support programs to help refugees overcome the trauma of their experiences of displacement. Day-to-day life can be difficult after such an experience, and this support helps refugees to feel a sense of independence, control, and dignity.

### 5\. Water\, Sanitation\, and Hygiene \(WASH\)

Another important step is to help refugees establish access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Mercy Corps works to establish effective water and sanitation programs for refugees worldwide.
