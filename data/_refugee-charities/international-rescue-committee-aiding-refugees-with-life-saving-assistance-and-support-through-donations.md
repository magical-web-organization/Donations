**The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is a leading humanitarian organization that responds to, and helps people affected by, conflict and disaster. The IRC has been working for more than 80 years in over 40 countries across the globe.**

## What Does International Rescue Committee do to Help Refugees?

The IRC works to help refugees, displaced people, and asylum seekers who are facing life-threatening situations. The IRC believes that every person deserves a basic set of human rights and works to provide these rights to those who have had them stripped away. Some of the key programs that the IRC provides to refugees include:

### 1\. Emergency Aid

When refugees are forced to flee their homes, they often have to leave everything behind. The IRC provides emergency aid, such as food, water, shelter, and medical care, to help refugees survive in the short-term.

### 2\. Protection and Safety

Refugees are at risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation. The IRC works to protect and keep refugees safe, with a focus on women, children, and other vulnerable populations.

### 3\. Education

Many refugees are unable to attend school due to conflict or displacement. The IRC provides education to refugee children, as well as adult learning programs.

### 4\. Health

The IRC provides healthcare services to refugees, including vaccinations, maternal and child health, and mental health services.

## How Does International Rescue Committee Do It?

The IRC employs several innovative approaches to provide help and support to refugees. The organization works directly with local communities, governments, and other organizations to provide aid and assistance. Some of the key strategies that the IRC uses includes:

### 1\. Empowering Local Communities

The IRC employs a community-led approach, which helps build the capacity of local communities to become self-sufficient and better equipped to respond to crises.

### 2\. Innovation

The IRC is committed to innovation to create new, better solutions to empowering refugees. The organization has developed several innovative technologies, including a mobile app used to provide refugee education.

### 3\. Partnerships

The IRC works in partnership with other organizations, including the United Nations, local governments, and private sector partners, to provide innovative and lasting solutions.
