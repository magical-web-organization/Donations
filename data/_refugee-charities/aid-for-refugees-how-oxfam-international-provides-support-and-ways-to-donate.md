According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently over 26 million refugees around the world, with more than half of them being under the age of 18. These numbers have been steadily increasing over the years, driven by various crises like wars, natural disasters, and economic instability. When people are forced to flee their homes, they often leave everything behind and become vulnerable to a range of risks, such as hunger, disease, and violence. That's where humanitarian organizations like Oxfam International step in to provide assistance and support to refugees.

## Who is Oxfam International?

**Oxfam International is a global organization that focuses on fighting poverty and injustice. They work in over 90 countries to help people improve their livelihoods, access basic services like water and healthcare, and secure their rights. Oxfam International has been active for over 70 years, and during that time, they have responded to countless humanitarian crises and emergencies, including those that involve refugees.**

## What Does Oxfam International Do to Help Refugees?

When refugees are displaced from their homes, they often need various types of support to survive and rebuild their lives. Oxfam International provides the following types of assistance to refugees:

### \- Emergency Aid

In the initial stages of a crisis, Oxfam International provides emergency aid to refugees, which includes life-saving items like clean water, food, shelter, and medical supplies. They work with local partners to distribute these supplies and ensure that they reach the most vulnerable people.

### \- Protection and Advocacy

Being a refugee can put people at risk of exploitation, violence, and discrimination. Oxfam International works to protect and advocate for the rights of refugees, particularly women and girls who are often more vulnerable to abuse. They provide legal assistance, counselling, and community outreach to prevent and respond to violence.

### \- Livelihoods Support

Many refugees are unable to work or generate income because of their displacement. Oxfam International helps refugees to regain their livelihoods by providing training, job opportunities, and entrepreneurship support. This enables refugees to become self-sufficient and contribute to their new communities.

### \- Education and Skills Training

Access to education can be limited for refugees, especially those in temporary or unstable situations. Oxfam International works to provide refugee children and youth with access to education and vocational training. This helps them to develop the skills they need to build a secure future for themselves and their families.

## How Can I Donate to Oxfam International?

If you would like to support Oxfam International's efforts to help refugees, there are various ways to donate:

### \- Online Donations

You can make a one-time or recurring donation to [Oxfam International](https://www.oxfam.org/en) through their website. You can choose to support a specific area of their work, such as refugees, or make a general donation.

### \- Phone Donations

### \- Other Ways to Support

If you are not able to make a financial donation, you can still support Oxfam International by volunteering, fundraising, or spreading the word about their work. You can also donate items like clothes and household goods to their charity shops.

In conclusion, **Oxfam International is a valuable resource for refugees in times of crisis. Their work helps to ensure that refugees have access to the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity.
