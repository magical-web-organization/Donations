**Big Brothers Big Sisters of America (BBBSA) is a non-profit organization that helps children achieve their full potential through one-to-one mentoring. The charity has been around for over a century and has worked with millions of youth in the United States.** In this article, we will learn about what BBBSA does to help with community development as a charity, how they do it, and how you can donate to support their cause.

## What Does BBBSA Do?

BBBSA's main goal is to make a positive impact in the lives of children through mentoring relationships. They do this by matching children, referred to as "Littles," with caring and supportive adult volunteers, referred to as "Bigs." These mentoring relationships are long-term and aim to help Littles develop socially, emotionally, and academically.

Through this program, BBBSA helps to create positive relationships that have a significant impact on a child's life. According to BBBSA, Littles who have mentors are more likely to graduate from high school, be successful in their careers, and lead healthy, productive lives.

## How Does BBBSA Help with Community Development?

BBBSA believes that a child's success is not just about their individual efforts but is also influenced by the community around them. Therefore, BBBSA focuses on developing positive relationships within the community to help create a supportive environment for Littles.

BBBSA collaborates with local businesses, schools, and community organizations to provide resources and opportunities for Littles to learn and grow. The organization also organizes various events, programs, and workshops that help build relationships within the community and provide Littles with a positive, supportive environment.

## How Can You Donate to Support BBBSA's Cause?

BBBSA is a non-profit organization that relies heavily on community support to fund their programs and initiatives. [Donations can be made on their website](https://www.bbbs.org/), where you can choose to make a one-time donation or set up a regular, recurring gift. Donations to BBBSA are tax-deductible and are used to support programs that help Littles achieve their full potential.

Volunteering is also a great way to support BBBSA's cause. The organization is always looking for caring, supportive adults to become Bigs and provide mentorship to Littles. If you are interested in becoming a Big, you can visit their website to learn more about the process and requirements.

In conclusion, **Big Brothers Big Sisters of America is a charity that focuses on community development by providing mentorship to children in need.
