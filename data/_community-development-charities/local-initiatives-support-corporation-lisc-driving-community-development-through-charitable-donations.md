LISC carries out community development through a network of local organizations and community leaders. The organization contracts with local community development corporations (CDCs) to implement its programs at the local community level. The CDCs are then responsible for determining the specific needs in their communities and identifying how LISC can provide support.

LISC's approach to community development harnesses the expertise of these local organizations who are uniquely attuned to the needs of their neighborhoods. LISC's partnership with CDCs ensures that projects are designed with, not for, the local community to ensure relevance.
