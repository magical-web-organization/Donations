**Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing affordable housing to communities around the world. Founded in 1976, Habitat has helped over 29 million people in 1,400 communities build or improve their homes.**

## What Does Habitat for Humanity Do?

At its core, Habitat for Humanity aims to break the cycle of poverty by providing families with safe, decent, and affordable housing. Habitat homes are not free - families who receive a Habitat home must contribute sweat equity by volunteering on the construction site alongside Habitat volunteers. Habitat also provides families with affordable mortgages, which allows them to build equity in their homes and break the cycle of poverty.

But Habitat's mission is about more than just building houses - it's about building communities. Habitat projects aim to bring people together, forging social connections and building strong, supportive neighborhoods.

## How Does Habitat for Humanity Do It?

Habitat for Humanity projects typically involve a mix of volunteers, community partners, and home buyers. Habitat volunteers come from all walks of life and include corporate teams, faith groups, and individuals. These volunteers work alongside Habitat homeowners to build their homes.

Habitat also partners with local governments, businesses and community organizations to access land, funding and other resources. This enables Habitat to build houses more efficiently and to more effectively support the families they serve.

## How Can I Donate?

Habitat for Humanity relies on the support of individuals, corporations, churches, and other organizations to fund its programs. There are several ways to support Habitat's mission:

* **Make a financial donation**: You can [donate online](https://www.habitat.org/), by mail, or by phone. Habitat for Humanity also offers recurring donation options for those who want to make an ongoing impact.
* **Volunteer your time**: Habitat for Humanity relies on volunteers to help build homes and support their mission. No construction experience is necessary - there are plenty of ways to get involved!
* **Donate materials**: Habitat for Humanity accepts donations of building materials, tools, and other items needed for construction projects.
* **Shop at the ReStore**: Habitat for Humanity operates ReStores, which sell new and gently used home goods and building materials. Proceeds support Habitat's mission.

## Conclusion

Habitat for Humanity is more than just a charity - it's a movement. By working to provide affordable housing, Habitat is helping to break the cycle of poverty and support strong, vibrant communities. Whether you choose to donate your time, money, or resources to Habitat for Humanity, you can be confident that you're helping to make a positive impact in the world.
