The Latter-day Saints (LDS) church, commonly known as the Mormon church, is known for its emphasis on tithing, which requires members to donate 10% of their income to the church. This has left some members wondering if the LDS church tracks their income to ensure that they are fulfilling this requirement.

## The Church's Stance on Tithing

The LDS church teaches that tithing is a fundamental principle of the gospel and a commandment from God. They also believe that the money donated from tithing helps to fund the church's operations and charitable efforts around the world.

The church encourages its members to pay their tithing willingly and without pressure or coercion. They emphasize that the decision to tithe is a personal one, and that each member is responsible for determining how much they can afford to give.

## Does the LDS Church Track Members' Income?

Despite the church's emphasis on tithing, there is no evidence to suggest that the LDS church actively tracks its members' income to ensure that they are donating 10%.

The church does not require members to provide proof of their income or the amount of tithing they have paid. Additionally, members are free to choose the method and frequency of their tithing payments, whether it be through online donations, cash or check donations, or automatic deductions from their bank account.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that the LDS church tracks its members' income to ensure that they are donating 10% of their income. The church's emphasis on tithing is a personal and voluntary decision made by each individual member.

The LDS church has a strong commitment to its members and to its charitable works around the world. The tithing donations received from members play a crucial role in supporting these efforts, but it is ultimately up to each member to decide how much they are able and willing to contribute.
