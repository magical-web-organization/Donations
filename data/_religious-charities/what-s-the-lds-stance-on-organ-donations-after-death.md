Every year, millions of people around the world benefit from organ donations. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, over 39,000 transplants took place in the US alone in 2020. However, there are still many misconceptions and concerns surrounding the practice, including religious beliefs. This article will address the question: What is the LDS stance on organ donations after death?

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), commonly referred to as the Mormon Church, is a sect of Christianity that was founded in the 19th century in the United States. The church encourages its members to be benevolent and charitable, and organ donation is seen as a way to help others in need.

## The LDS Church and Organ Donation

The LDS Church has not taken an official position on organ donation, meaning that it neither encourages nor discourages members from donating their organs after death. Instead, the church leaves the decision up to the individual members and their families. 

In a statement released in 1992, the church expressed support for the concept of organ donation and confirmed that it is an individual decision to be made by the family. The statement also emphasized the importance of respecting the dead and their families, and ensuring that the decision to donate is made freely and without pressure.

## Importance of Free Choice

The LDS Church places a great deal of importance on free agency, the belief that individuals have the God-given right to choose their actions in life. This principle can also be applied to the decision of organ donation, as it is ultimately up to the individual to choose whether or not to donate their organs after death.

However, the church does offer guidance and counsel to its members as they make these important decisions. The church encourages its members to consider the potential benefits of organ donation and to make their wishes known to their families.

## Conclusion

In summary, the LDS Church does not take an official stance on organ donation after death, leaving the decision up to individual members and their families. The church emphasizes the importance of respecting the free agency of its members and encourages them to make their wishes known to their families. Organ donation is seen as a way to help others in need, and it is ultimately up to each individual to decide whether or not to donate their organs after death.
