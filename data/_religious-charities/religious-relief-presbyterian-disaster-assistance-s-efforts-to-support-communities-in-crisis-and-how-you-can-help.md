**Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA) is a ministry of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) that has been responding to natural disasters, human-caused disasters, and complex emergencies around the world for more than 50 years. In 1988, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) created PDA to promote the church's response to the increasing number of natural disasters and complex emergencies affecting communities around the world.**

PDA's mission is to "**Enable congregations and mission partners of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) to witness to the healing love of Christ through caring for communities adversely affected by crisis and catastrophic events**." As a faith-based organization, PDA is committed to providing compassionate care and practical assistance to those in need, regardless of their religious beliefs, gender, race, or nationality.

## What Does PDA Do?

PDA takes a holistic approach to disaster response, recognizing that disasters affect not only physical structures but also communities and their social and spiritual well-being. PDA provides disaster response and recovery assistance through three main areas of focus:

### Emergency Response

When a disaster occurs, PDA responds by providing emergency grants to help people meet their immediate needs for food, water, shelter, and medical care. PDA also sends response teams to affected areas to provide emotional and spiritual care to survivors and to assess the long-term needs of affected communities.

### Disaster Recovery

PDA provides support for long-term disaster recovery efforts by partnering with local organizations, government agencies, and other faith-based organizations. PDA works with these partners to help communities rebuild their homes, businesses, schools, and other critical infrastructure.

### Refugee and Asylum Ministries

PDA also supports ministries that provide care and support to refugees and asylum seekers who are fleeing war, persecution, and other forms of violence. PDA provides financial assistance to these ministries and works to raise awareness about the plight of refugees and asylum seekers.

## How Does PDA Do It?

PDA relies on the generosity of donors and volunteers to carry out its mission. PDA receives funding from individuals, congregations, and other organizations who want to support disaster response and recovery efforts. PDA also receives grants from government agencies and other non-profit organizations that recognize PDA's proven track record of effective disaster response.

PDA also relies on volunteers who are willing to give their time and skills to help people affected by disasters. PDA has a network of trained volunteers who can provide emotional and spiritual care to survivors, help with debris removal and home repairs, and provide other services as needed.

PDA works closely with partners at the local and national levels to coordinate disaster response and recovery efforts. PDA partners with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)'s regional offices and congregations to identify areas in need of assistance and to provide resources and guidance to those who want to help.
