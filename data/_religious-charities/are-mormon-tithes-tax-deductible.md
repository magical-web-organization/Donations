## Introduction

One of the key principles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the payment of tithing. As part of this religious practice, members of the church are expected to give 10% of their income to the church. However, many members wonder if they can claim their tithing as a tax deduction.

## The Simple Answer

The long and short of it is, yes, members of the LDS church can claim their tithing as a tax deduction. The IRS recognizes tithing as a charitable contribution, which means it can be deducted from your taxable income.

## Some Limitations

However, there are some limitations to claiming tithing as a tax deduction. The first limitation is that you must itemize your deductions in order to claim it. If you take the standard deduction, you won't be able to deduct your tithing.

The second limitation is that your charitable contributions (including your tithing) are limited to a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income (AGI). For most people, this limit is 60%, but for some high-income earners, it can be as low as 20%.

Finally, it's worth noting that not all contributions to the LDS church are tax-deductible. For example, you can't deduct payments made for a child's mission or for membership dues.

## Conclusion

In summary, members of the LDS church are able to claim their tithing as a tax deduction, as long as they itemize their deductions and meet the other requirements of the IRS. However, there are some limitations to be aware of, so it's important to consult with a tax professional if you have any questions or concerns.
