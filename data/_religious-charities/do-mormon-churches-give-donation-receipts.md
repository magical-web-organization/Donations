As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), you may have wondered whether the Church gives donation receipts for the tithes and offerings you contribute. This is an important question to consider, especially if you want to keep track of your charitable contributions for tax purposes. In this article, we'll answer the question "Do Mormon Churches give donation receipts?" and look at why this is such an important topic.

## The Short Answer

Yes, Mormon Churches give donation receipts, but only if the donor requests one. This means that if you want a receipt for your tithes and offerings, you'll need to ask for one from your ward or branch clerk. The clerk will then generate a receipt for you, which you can keep as proof of your donation.

## Why It Matters

There are several reasons why it's important to know whether you can get a donation receipt from the Church. Here are a few of the most important ones:

### Tax Deductions

One of the main reasons people want donation receipts is so they can claim a tax deduction for their charitable contributions. If you live in the United States and itemize your deductions on your tax return, you can deduct your tithes and offerings to the Church, as long as you have a receipt for them. Without a receipt, you won't be able to claim the deduction.

### Keeping Track of Donations

Another reason to request a donation receipt is to keep track of your charitable contributions. If you're like most people, you probably donate to multiple charities and organizations throughout the year. If you don't keep good records of your donations, it can be hard to remember how much you gave to each one. By requesting a receipt from the Church, you can add it to your file of charitable contributions and have an accurate record of your giving.

### Proof of Payment

Finally, having a donation receipt from the Church can serve as proof that you made a payment. This can be useful if there is ever a discrepancy between what you believe you donated and what the Church says you donated. By having a receipt, you have tangible proof of your payment and can easily resolve any issues that may arise.

## How to Get a Donation Receipt from the Church

Now that you know the importance of donation receipts and why you might need one, let's look at how you can get one from the Church. Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Contact your ward or branch clerk and ask for a donation receipt.
2. Provide the clerk with the date and amount of your donation.
3. Wait for the clerk to generate the receipt.
4. Once you receive the receipt, keep it in a safe place with your other charitable contribution receipts.

It's important to note that the Church may only be able to generate receipts for donations made within the last two years. If you need a receipt for a donation made more than two years ago, you may need to contact the Church's Finance Department for assistance.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Mormon Churches do give donation receipts, but only if you request one. It's important to know this so you can keep accurate records of your charitable contributions, claim tax deductions, and have proof of payment. If you need a donation receipt from the Church, simply contact your ward or branch clerk and ask for one. By taking this simple step, you can have peace of mind knowing that you have a record of your donation and can easily access it if needed.
