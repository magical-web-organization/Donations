Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is a global organization that aims to save wildlife and wild places worldwide. Here are some of the ways that WCS helps animals:

## Research and Conservation

WCS conducts fieldwork and research to better understand animal populations and their behaviors. This information is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Some of the research that WCS conducts includes:

* Studying animal behavior, such as migration patterns and breeding habits
* Monitoring animal populations to track changes in their numbers and distribution
* Identifying threats to wildlife and analyzing the impact of human activities on ecosystems

WCS also works to protect natural habitats and ecosystems that are essential to the survival of wildlife.

## Education and Outreach

In addition to research and conservation efforts, WCS is also focused on educating and engaging the public in conservation initiatives. The organization believes that educating people about the importance of wildlife and their habitats is essential to building a global community of conservationists.

Some of the ways in which WCS educates and reaches out to the public include:

* Hosting educational programs and events for schools and communities
* Conducting outreach and advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about conservation issues
* Providing online resources and tools for people to learn about wildlife and conservation efforts

## Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation

Another important aspect of WCS's work is rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife that has been injured, orphaned, or affected by human activity. WCS has a team of experts and veterinarians who are specially trained in wildlife rescue and rehabilitation.

Some of the animals that WCS has rescued and rehabilitated include:

* Elephants
* Tigers
* Gorillas
* Sea turtles
* Chimpanzees

By working to rehabilitate and release animals back into the wild, WCS is helping to preserve and protect threatened and endangered species.
