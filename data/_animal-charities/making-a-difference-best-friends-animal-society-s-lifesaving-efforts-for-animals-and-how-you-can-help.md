If you're an animal lover, you've probably heard of Best Friends Animal Society. This organization has been making a difference in the lives of animals since 1984. Based in Kanab, Utah, Best Friends Animal Society operates the largest no-kill animal sanctuary in the country, providing a home to animals who would otherwise be at risk of being euthanized. But that's just the beginning of what this organization does to help animals.

## What Does Best Friends Animal Society Do?

Best Friends Animal Society operates a number of programs and initiatives aimed at improving the lives of companion animals, both in shelters and in homes. Some of their most notable programs include:

### No-Kill Initiatives

Best Friends Animal Society is committed to making the country entirely no-kill by 2025. They work with animal shelters and rescue groups across the country to implement the best practices in animal welfare, including behavior training, medical care, and adoption programs. They also advocate for animal welfare laws and regulations to protect animals from suffering and neglect.

### Animal Sanctuary

The best-known program of Best Friends Animal Society is undoubtedly their animal sanctuary. Located in Kanab, Utah, this sanctuary is home to more than 1,500 animals. Each animal has a customized care plan tailored to their unique needs. Animals are provided with medical care, behavioral training, and socialization in preparation for adoption or transfer to another rescue organization.

### Community Cat Programs

Community cats are cats who live outdoors and are often cared for by members of the community. Best Friends Animal Society works with communities across the country to manage the population of community cats through spay-and-neuter programs, vaccination programs, and education. They also operate several cat adoption programs that save thousands of cats each year.

### Dog Adoption Programs

The organization operates with a staff of over 500 employees and has over 2,000 active volunteers. Volunteers help with everything from animal care to administrative tasks, and many choose to visit the animal sanctuary in Kanab to assist with animal care in person.

Best Friends Animal Society is supported entirely by donations from individuals and corporations. Donations go toward the care of animals in the sanctuary, support for no-kill programs across the country, and advocacy efforts to improve animal welfare laws and regulations.
