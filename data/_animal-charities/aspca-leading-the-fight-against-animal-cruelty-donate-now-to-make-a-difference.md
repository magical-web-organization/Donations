**The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a non-profit organization that works towards the prevention of animal cruelty and promotes their welfare.

The ASPCA also collaborates with other organizations to transport animals to safe locations, away from disaster zones.

### Adoption

ASPCA has an adoption center where rescued animals are kept and made available for adoption. **The adoption center houses a range of animals, from cats and dogs to farm animals like horses and cows.** The ASPCA thoroughly evaluates potential adopters to ensure the animals are going to respectful and loving homes.

### Medical Care
