Mental health issues have been increasing worldwide, and the need for professional help is higher than ever. Thanks to technology, help is readily available through the Crisis Text Line. In this article, we will discuss how Crisis Text Line helps with mental health, how they do it, and how you can donate to this noble cause.

## What is Crisis Text Line?

**Crisis Text Line is a non-profit organization that provides free, confidential mental health support via text messages. The platform also extends support to people facing domestic violence, abuse, and other crises. Crisis Text Line is operational 24/7, and anyone in distress can contact it from anywhere in the United States.**

## How Does Crisis Text Line Work?

Crisis Text Line connects users in distress with trained volunteers called “Crisis Counselors.” Users text the number 741741 or use Facebook Messenger to be connected to a trained volunteer counselor. Crisis Counselors undergo comprehensive training to respond to different kinds of crises and provide help without judgment. The platform is completely confidential, and the user’s data is kept anonymous.

After a conversation, the platform provides a “cool-down” period to users, during which they receive regulated follow-up texts to continue support. Crisis Text Line’s state-of-the-art systems and procedures ensure accountability, quality of service, and the safety and security of users.

## Why Donate to Crisis Text Line?

As a non-profit organization, Crisis Text Line is solely reliant on donations and support to keep up its services. Your valuable donations help support their mission of providing free, 24/7, high-quality mental health support to those in crisis.
