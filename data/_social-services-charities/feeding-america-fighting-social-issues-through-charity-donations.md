**Feeding America is a nationwide network of food banks and pantries that strives to eradicate hunger and alleviate poverty in America. The nonprofit organization functions as a charity and one of its primary goals is to reduce food waste by redirecting surplus food to food banks and shelters. Feeding America has been operating since 1979 and is one of the largest charitable organizations in the United States.**

## What Does Feeding America Do?

Feeding America is committed to addressing the issue of hunger in America. The organization distributes over 4.3 billion meals each year to individuals and families in need across the country. Many of the recipients of Feeding America’s services are children, seniors, and veterans who are at a higher risk of food insecurity.

Feeding America aims to end hunger by;

* Engaging in hunger relief programs and initiatives that provide access to nutritious food.
* Addressing root causes and systemic issues that contribute to hunger and poverty
* Advocating on behalf of individuals and families facing food insecurity

The charity collaborates with various entities to implement effective food programs including schools, business organizations, healthcare providers, and government agencies.

## How Does Feeding America Work?

Feeding America operates a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries, as well as other food sources such as farms, retailers, and manufacturers to provide access to nutritious food. The organization works by creating partnerships with nationwide retailers, farmers, and manufacturers to collect food that would otherwise go to waste. These surplus foods are then distributed to their member food banks throughout the country.

The surplus food donations are critical in feeding people who are struggling with hunger across the country. Feeding America handles the logistics of moving the food from donating sources to the food banks using a sophisticated transportation system handled by staff and volunteers.

Beyond food collection, Feeding America also facilitates initiatives aimed at addressing broader poverty and hunger issues. One of their most significant initiatives is the Hunger Action Month, which is observed in September. It is a month-long campaign aimed at raising awareness and fighting hunger.
