**Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) is a non-profit organization that aims to improve the health and well-being of children and their families. Founded in 1974, RMHC operates under the belief that when a child is sick, the entire family is affected. RMHC provides essential services and support to families with critically ill and injured children, helping to alleviate some of the stress and financial burden associated with caring for a sick child.**

## Programs and Services Offered by RMHC

### Ronald McDonald Houses

One of the primary services offered by RMHC is its network of Ronald McDonald Houses (RMHs). These are temporary homes provided to families while their child receives medical treatment at a nearby hospital. The first RMH was opened in 1974 in Philadelphia, and since then, RMHC has expanded to over 64 countries, and more than 400 houses worldwide.

RMHs are designed to be a "home away from home" for families during a difficult time. Each RMH is equipped with private family suites, shared living spaces, and on-site amenities, including kitchens, laundry facilities, and play areas for children. By providing a comfortable and supportive environment, RMHs help to reduce the stress of living in a hospital and allow families to focus on their child's recovery.

### Ronald McDonald Family Rooms

In addition to RMHs, RMHC operates Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in hospitals. These are dedicated spaces within the hospital where families can rest and relax, away from the hospital environment. Family rooms offer amenities such as sleeping rooms, showers, and kitchens, as well as computers and internet access to help families stay connected with loved ones.

### Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles

RMHC also operates Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles, which provide medical services to children in underserved communities. These mobile clinics offer a range of services, including dental care, immunizations, and health screenings. By bringing medical care directly to underserved communities, RMHC is helping to provide essential services to families who may not have access to healthcare.

## How to Support RMHC

RMHC relies on the support of donors and volunteers to fund its programs and services. Here are some ways that you can get involved and support this worthwhile cause:

### Donate

RMHC accepts donations of any size, which are used to fund programs and services for families. You can [make a donation online](https://rmhc.org/), by mail, or in person at your local RMHC chapter.
