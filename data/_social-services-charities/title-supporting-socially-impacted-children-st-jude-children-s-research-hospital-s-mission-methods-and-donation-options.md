**St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is a non-profit organization that is committed to finding cures for childhood diseases, while also helping to alleviate the social issues that often accompany these illnesses.

## What Social Issues Does St. Jude Address?

St. Jude acknowledges that the burden of childhood illness extends beyond the medical domain. Families with a child diagnosed with a life-threatening illness are often faced with a variety of social issues and difficulties, such as the financial burden of medical treatment, housing and transportation costs, and the emotional toll of coping with their child's illness. St. Jude works to address all of these issues by offering free medical care, providing housing and meals for families, and offering comprehensive support services to ease the burden and help families focus on their child's health.

In addition to medical care, St. Jude provides assistance with housing and other expenses for families who must travel to the hospital for treatment.

St. Jude also provides a variety of support services to patients and families, including emotional and psychological counseling, family support services, and education services.
