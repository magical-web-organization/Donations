**Special Olympics International (SOI) is a non-profit organization that provides athletic events and programs for people with intellectual disabilities. Established in 1968, SOI has become one of the biggest movements for social change in the world. This foundation provides opportunities for people with cognitive impairment to develop physical fitness, build self-esteem, and create connections with others. But SOI does much more than that. They also help address social issues affecting people with intellectual disabilities.**

## Social Issues Addressed by SOI

### Prejudice and Discrimination

Prejudice and discrimination are the biggest social issues that people with intellectual disabilities face. The lack of understanding of this condition often leads to exclusion, lack of job opportunities, and stigmatization. SOI aims to eliminate these prejudices by promoting the abilities and strengths of every athlete that they serve. The foundation helps athletes develop their talent and showcase their abilities in athletic events. It provides public opportunities to demonstrate that people with intellectual disabilities have value to add to society.

### Lack of Inclusion

People with cognitive impairment often face social exclusion, making it hard for them to make valuable friendships and connections with those around them. SOI provides a platform for athletes to socialize, create friendships with others, and participate in team events. Through programs such as Young Athletes and Unified Partner, the organization helps athletes develop skills and build lifelong relationships with others.

## How Does SOI Address These Issues?

SOI addresses social issues by providing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting inclusion and acceptance. Some of the programs offered by SOI include:

### Unified Sports

This program has the fundamental awareness that everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses, and by placing people of different skill sets, backgrounds and abilities into a team, everyone can learn from each other. This unified competition provides an opportunity to develop camaraderie and promote understanding between people with cognitive impairment and those without.

### Young Athletes

The Young Athletes program targets children between the ages of 2 to 7 with intellectual disabilities. This program helps to promote their physical, social, and cognitive abilities through activities and events that help them develop these faculties at an early age.

### Athlete Leadership

The Athlete Leadership Program provides opportunities for athletes to take control. This program enables athletes with intellectual disabilities to develop leadership skills and advocate for their needs. By taking control of their lives, they can become agents of change in their society.
