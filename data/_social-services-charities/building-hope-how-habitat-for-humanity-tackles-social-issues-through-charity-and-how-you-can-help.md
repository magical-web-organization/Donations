The organization utilizes a "sweat equity" model in which families who are selected to receive assistance must contribute labor to the construction of their homes or the homes of others in the program. This approach empowers families to take an active role in their own housing solutions.

Habitat for Humanity works with partner organizations, including local governments, foundations, corporations, and faith-based organizations, to fund and support its housing programs.
