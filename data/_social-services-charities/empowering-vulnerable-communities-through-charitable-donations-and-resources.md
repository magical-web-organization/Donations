### Support Groups

Support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, provide individuals with a supportive community of peers who understand the challenges of addiction.

## Domestic Violence

Domestic violence is a pervasive issue that affects individuals and families across all socioeconomic levels. Fortunately, there are several resources and strategies available to address this issue.

### Domestic Violence Shelters

Domestic violence shelters provide temporary housing and support services to individuals and families fleeing domestic violence. Many of these shelters also offer legal advocacy, counseling services, and job training programs.
