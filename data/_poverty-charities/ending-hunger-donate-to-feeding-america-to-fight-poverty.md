## What is Feeding America?

Feeding America is a national network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs across the United States. The organization works to feed children, families, seniors, and individuals who face hunger and food insecurity. Feeding America's mission is to reduce food waste, support sustainable agriculture, and provide emergency food assistance to those who need it most.

## How Does Feeding America Help with Poverty?

Feeding America helps to reduce poverty and hunger by providing food assistance to people in need. The organization works with local food banks and partner agencies to distribute food, meals, and groceries to communities across the country. This helps to ensure that people who are struggling to put food on the table have access to nutritious meals and snacks.

Feeding America also advocates for policies that support the fight against hunger and poverty. The organization works with government agencies, businesses, and other partners to improve access to food, increase food security, and reduce food waste.
