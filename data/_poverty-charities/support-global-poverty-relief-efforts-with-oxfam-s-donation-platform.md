**Oxfam is a global organization that aims to eradicate the ongoing issue of poverty worldwide. They envision a future where every person lives in a dignified and equitable society, free from poverty. Oxfam does this through various programs, interventions, and advocacy campaigns that create long-term sustainable solutions for poverty.**

## What Does Oxfam Do?

Oxfam's primary goal is to promote global justice by addressing the interrelated issues of poverty, inequality, and discrimination. Here are some of their initiatives:

### Long-Term Development Programs

Oxfam works to provide people with the resources and skills they need to overcome poverty. They aim to create sustainable and durable changes that improve the quality of people's lives. Here are a few examples of development programs:

* Supporting small-scale farmers so they can grow enough food to feed themselves and their communities
* Investing in clean water and sanitation infrastructure to improve health and reduce disease
* Providing training and support to entrepreneurs, so they can develop sustainable businesses and create jobs
* Promoting education initiatives that increase literacy rates, empower individuals, and help people make better-informed decisions about their lives

### Emergency Response

Natural disasters, humanitarian crises, and conflict often have the most significant impact on the poorest, most vulnerable people in society. Oxfam provides emergency relief efforts to people in need due to:

* Natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods)
* Conflict and crisis situations
* Public health emergencies (e.g., Ebola)

They distribute vital aid, such as clean water, food, and medical supplies, to those who require it most. In addition, they work to build more resilient communities for future shocks.

### Advocacy and Campaigning

Oxfam global campaigns for change to promote a more equitable and just world. They work to persuade national governments and the international community to create policies that address the root causes of poverty and perpetuate inequality. Examples include campaigns such as the "Enough Food For Everyone IF" campaign in 2013, which aimed to tackle the systemic issue of global food poverty.

## How Does Oxfam Do It?

Oxfam uses a holistic approach when addressing poverty. They work directly with communities, working collaboratively with:

* Local partners
* Public stakeholders
* Other organizations working locally

Oxfam believes in empowering people so that they can take charge of their future. They do this by:

* Providing training and resources to community leaders
* Working with locals to develop sustainable solutions for their problems
* Collaborating with local organizations to build more resilient systems

Oxfam also leverages its insight to advocate for change at an international level. They use research, policy analysis, and media campaigns to bring attention to poverty and its drivers.
