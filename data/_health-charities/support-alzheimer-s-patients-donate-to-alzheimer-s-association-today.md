Alzheimer's Association is a non-profit organization that works towards creating awareness about Alzheimer's disease, raising funds for scientific research, and providing support and care to people affected by the disease. The organization's mission is to build a world without Alzheimer's disease.

## Research Initiatives

Alzheimer's Association provides funding for research aimed at finding ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure Alzheimer's disease. The organization has funded over $485 million towards scientific research aimed at understanding the disease, identifying potential treatments, and developing prevention strategies. With this funding, their researchers are working tirelessly to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease.

## Support and Care Programs

Alzheimer's Association provides support and care programs for individuals and families affected by Alzheimer's disease. This includes a 24/7 helpline accessible nationwide, care consultation services to help families navigate difficult decisions, and education programs for caregivers to learn more about the disease.

Through their various support and care programs, they offer a network of care, support and resources to aid patients and caregivers across the globe.

## Raising Awareness

Alzheimer's Association also works tirelessly to raise awareness about the disease, its impact on patients, caregivers and their families, and the need for continued research. The organization provides educational materials targeted at families, professionals, caregivers, and communities to educate them about Alzheimer's disease and the resources available to them.

The Alzheimer's Association's efforts work towards reducing the stigma around memory disorders and helps patients and their families find the resources and support they need.
