**The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) is a leading nonprofit organization that is dedicated to finding effective treatments and a cure for cystic fibrosis (CF). CFF funds innovative research, provides patient care and advocacy, and offers resources for patients and their families.**

## What is Cystic Fibrosis?

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that affects the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. It's caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which produces a defective protein that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive system and other areas of the body. This build-up can lead to severe lung infections, poor growth and malnutrition, and other serious, life-threatening complications.

## What Does Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Do?

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation works tirelessly to improve the lives of people living with cystic fibrosis (CF). Here are some of the ways CFF helps:

### 1\. Funding Research

CFF has invested over $4.7 billion in research since its inception in 1955, making it one of the largest investors in CF research worldwide. This has resulted in amazing breakthroughs in treatment, such as the discovery of the CF gene, development of CF-specific drugs, and advances in gene therapy.

### 2\. Providing Patient Care

CFF provides a wide range of services to help people living with CF live full, healthy lives. These services include funding for clinical care centers, providing care guidelines for healthcare professionals, advocating for health policies that benefit the CF community, and much more.

### 3\. Advocacy and Community Engagement

CFF is committed to advocating for policies and actions that will help patients access the care and treatments they need. Through education, outreach, and community engagement efforts, CFF raises awareness about cystic fibrosis among the general public and helps empower patients and their families to be strong advocates for their own care.
