World Vision is a Christian humanitarian organization that has a mission to work for the well-being of children, and to fight poverty and injustice around the world. They have an extensive history of more than 70 years of helping communities in need, and they operate in nearly 100 countries around the world.

## What Does World Vision do in Disaster Relief?

World Vision has a dedicated approach to disaster relief, which is defined by 5 key components. These include:

World Vision staff are well-trained to assess the needs of communities hit by disasters. They conduct needs assessments to determine the needs of the victims and devise a response plan accordingly.
