## Volunteer

If you are healthy and able, volunteering your time can make a big difference. Volunteering can involve anything from delivering groceries to elderly individuals to helping build temporary shelters. Here are some organizations where you can volunteer:

* VolunteerMatch
* Red Cross
* UN Volunteers
* AmeriCorps

## Help the Homeless

Homeless populations are at a high risk of contracting illnesses during a crisis. You can help by donating to a local shelter or food bank. Additionally, organizations such as the National Coalition for the Homeless advise people to provide hygiene products such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and sanitizing wipes. You can also donate clothing, blankets, and sleeping bags.

## Check on Your Neighbors

During a crisis, it's important to check on your neighbors, especially those who are elderly, disabled or have pre-existing medical conditions. Offer to pick up groceries or medications for them so that they can avoid going outside. Additionally, if you live near a medical professional, you can offer to provide assistance such as child care or pet care to enable them to work long hours.

## Conclusion

During difficult times, it's important to remember our shared humanity and to help the most vulnerable among us. Donating to charitable organizations, volunteering, helping the homeless, and checking on your neighbors are all important ways you can make a difference.
