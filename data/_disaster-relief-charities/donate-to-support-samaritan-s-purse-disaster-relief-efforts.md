**Natural disasters and emergencies can strike any time, leaving people and entire communities struggling to survive without basic necessities, such as shelter, clean water, food, and medical care. Samaritan's Purse is a Christian international relief organization that works to meet the urgent needs of vulnerable individuals and communities in crisis situations.** Here's how they operate and how to support their work through donations.

## What is Samaritan's Purse?

Founded in 1970 by an American evangelist and author, Dr. Bob Pierce, Samaritan's Purse is a non-profit organization that provides aid and support in the aftermath of natural disasters, war, famine, poverty, and other humanitarian crises around the world. The organization's mission is to demonstrate God's love in a practical way by providing physical and spiritual aid to people in need, regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity.

Samaritan's Purse operates in over 100 countries across six continents, assisting millions of people through various programs and projects ranging from disaster relief, emergency medical response, refugee care, clean water initiatives, education and vocational training, and community development.

## Disaster Relief: What does Samaritan's Purse do?

One of the key areas of Samaritan's Purse's humanitarian work is disaster relief. When natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, or wildfires strike, the organization rapidly mobilizes its staff and volunteers to provide emergency assistance to those affected. Some of the ways in which Samaritan's Purse responds to disasters include:

* Providing clean water, shelter, and tools for survival
* Conducting search and rescue operations
* Distributing food, blankets, hygiene kits, and other essential supplies
* Setting up emergency medical clinics and hospitals
* Offering trauma and psychosocial support to survivors
* Clearing debris and rebuilding homes and schools

Samaritan's Purse often partners with local churches, organizations, and governments to ensure that aid reaches those who need it the most. The organization also works to help communities build resilience against future disasters by providing disaster preparedness training and resources.
