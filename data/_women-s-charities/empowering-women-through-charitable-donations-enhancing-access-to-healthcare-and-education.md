Women have always played a significant role in the development of society. However, for a very long time they have not been provided with equal opportunities to access healthcare and education. A lack of access to these fundamental rights has stopped women from realizing their maximum potential, which in turn affects the growth and development of their families, communities and the country.

## The Importance of Education

Education is considered to be a fundamental right, and it is one of the key drivers of human development. Unfortunately, many women, especially in developing countries are denied proper access to education. There can be many reasons for this. For instance, poverty is one of the most significant factors that hold girls back from receiving an education. Other factors such as early marriage, cultural and social barriers also prevent girls from receiving the education they rightfully deserve.

Supporting women's access to education provides many benefits that can have profound and far-reaching positive impacts. Educated women have better health and nutrition outcomes, reduced rates of child mortality, and better economic opportunities. Educated women have the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions, and to take charge of their lives. They can also play a more active role in their communities, and can become agents of change that positively impact society.

## The Importance of Healthcare Access

Access to healthcare is another fundamental right that should be available to all women. In many developing countries, women face poor health outcomes due to lack of access to healthcare facilities and services. Women often face barriers such as cost, distance, and cultural norms that interfere with their access to healthcare services. This lack of access to healthcare services can have dire consequences such as maternal mortality, unsafe abortions, and other preventable diseases.

Supporting women's access to healthcare is fundamental to their physical and mental well-being. Access to healthcare not only saves lives, but it also improves the overall quality of life of women. When women's health improves, the well-being of their families, communities and the country also improve.
