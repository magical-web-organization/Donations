**Girls Not Brides is a global partnership of more than 1,500 civil society organizations committed to ending child marriage and enabling girls to fulfill their potential. The organization was created in 2011 with the goal of bringing attention to the issue of child marriage, and advocating for laws and policies that ensure all girls have access to the education, health care, and opportunities they need to thrive.**

## The Impact of Child Marriage on Girls

Child marriage has a profound impact on the lives of girls worldwide. When girls are married off at a young age, they are at risk of dropping out of school, becoming pregnant before they are physically and emotionally ready, and suffering from domestic violence and other forms of abuse. They are also at risk of developing serious health problems, such as fistula or other complications during childbirth. In addition, they are more likely to be impoverished and less able to contribute to their families and communities.

## What Girls Not Brides Does

Girls Not Brides works to create a world where every girl can exercise her right to choose whom she marries, when she marries, and whether she wants to have children. The organization's work is guided by the belief that every girl has the right to live free from violence and to fulfill her potential.
