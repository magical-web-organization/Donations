In the United States, hunger is a harsh reality for millions of children. According to a statistics report, one in seven children, or 10.7 million kids in America, live in households that struggle to put food on the table. As a result, No Kid Hungry, a charity organization, was established to end childhood hunger nationwide.

## What Does No Kid Hungry do?

**No Kid Hungry is a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending child hunger in America. First and foremost, their objective is to connect children with nutritious meals on a consistent basis to ensure they have the food they need every day to succeed.** To achieve this primary mission, No Kid Hungry takes various approaches:

1. **Providing Grants**: No Kid Hungry provides grants to schools, food banks, and other community organizations to support their efforts in feeding hungry children. They work closely with these groups to address the barriers that stand between kids and the food they need.
2. **Advocacy**: No Kid Hungry raises public awareness about the severity of childhood hunger and campaigns to ensure that government programs and policies feed children with nutritious foods.
3. **Support for School Meals**: No Kid Hungry works with school districts around the country to expand access to school breakfast and lunch programs.

## How Does No Kid Hungry Do It?

No Kid Hungry works in partnership and collaboration with key community-based organizations, government agencies, and corporate partners to build programmatic solutions to address the problem of childhood hunger. One example of their successful program is the School Breakfast Program, which is designed to offer more reliable access to healthy foods for students. In 2018, No Kid Hungry and its partners provided 123 million breakfast meals for kids.

They also teach families who are struggling with poverty-related barriers how to cook healthy, affordable meals at home through their Cooking Matters program, which has reached more than 226,000 parents and caregivers this year.
