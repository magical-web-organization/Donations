In a country like the United States, where food is abundant and easily accessible, it's often hard to imagine that there are still many people going hungry. However, hunger and food insecurity are still prevalent issues affecting millions of Americans, especially those in low-income communities.

**Enter Feeding America, the largest anti-hunger organization in the country. Since its establishment in 1979, Feeding America has been dedicated to providing food to those in need, reducing food waste, and raising awareness about hunger as a critical issue.**

## What Does Feeding America Do?

Feeding America's primary goal is to provide food for those who don't have access to it. This is done by partnering with local food banks and other charitable organizations to collect and distribute food to those in need. According to Feeding America, the organization **provides food to more than 40 million people each year through a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs nationwide.**

Feeding America also works towards reducing food waste. According to the USDA, 30-40% of food produced in the US is wasted. Feeding America helps to limit this waste by collecting and distributing surplus food from grocery stores, restaurants, and farms that would otherwise go to waste.

Aside from providing food, Feeding America also raises awareness about hunger as a critical issue. The organization conducts research and releases reports to provide information about food insecurity in the US, highlights the impact of the issue on different groups, and offers policy recommendations to address the root causes of hunger.

## How Does Feeding America Do It?

Feeding America works with a vast network of partners, volunteers, and donors to achieve its goals. **Food banks across the country receive food donations from Feeding America, which they then distribute to soup kitchens, food pantries, and other charitable organizations.** Feeding America also runs a Volunteer Engagement program that connects volunteers with local food banks and other organizations to help with food collection, sorting, and distribution.

Feeding America is a nonprofit organization and relies on donations to fund its various programs. The organization accepts donations in the form of cash, stocks/mutual funds, planned giving, and workplace giving. You can also set up a monthly donation or dedicate a gift to someone special.

## How Can I Donate to Feeding America?

Feeding America offers various ways for individuals, corporations, and other groups to support its mission of ending hunger in America. Here are some popular donation options:

1. **Make a Cash Donation**: You can make a one-time or recurring donation on [Feeding America's website](https://www.feedingamerica.org/). The organization also offers the option to donate in honor or memory of a loved one.
2. **Workplace Giving**: If you're an employee, many companies offer matching gift programs that could double your contribution to Feeding America. You can also start an employee giving campaign or participate in a workplace giving campaign.
3. **Planned Giving**: You can also consider making a lasting impact by including Feeding America in your estate planning or will.
4. **Volunteer**: Feeding America accepts volunteers of all ages and abilities. You can learn more about their Volunteer Engagement program and search for volunteering opportunities in your area on their website.
