**Heifer International is a global nonprofit organization that aims to tackle hunger and poverty sustainably across the world. Since its founding in 1944, the organization has been working to empower poor communities by providing hand-ups, not just handouts. Through Heifer International, people can donate funds that are used to provide training, resources and livestock to families in need around the world.**

## What Does Heifer International Do?

The main aim of Heifer International is to help people overcome hunger and poverty through sustainable livelihoods. The organization's sustainable livelihood development model is based on the principle that charity is not enough to provide long-term help to people who are struggling with poverty. Instead, **Heifer International provides resources and training to help struggling communities start their own sustainable businesses and lift themselves out of poverty.**

One of the key ways in which Heifer International achieves this is through providing farmers with livestock. Depending on the region, the organization provides animals such as cows, goats, bees, and water buffaloes. These animals provide a source of food, income, and manure for the farmers. The organization provides training to farmers on how to care for their animals and how to use their products for income generation.

Heifer International also provides seeds, equipment, and training to help farmers grow crops. In addition, the organization provides education on how to store and preserve food, as well as on nutrition and food safety. This helps farmers to produce more food and to provide better nutrition for their families.

## How Does Heifer International Fight Hunger?

Heifer International’s approach to fighting global hunger is centered around the concept of sustainable agriculture. The organization recognizes that sustainable agriculture is not only crucial for addressing issues of food scarcity but also crucial for promoting economic and social development in rural communities.

The organization also promotes sustainable farming practices, which help farmers to protect their soil and water resources, reduce pollution, and maintain the health of their communities.
