**International Medical Corps is a global non-profit organization that provides emergency relief and development assistance to communities affected by conflict, natural disasters, and poverty. Founded in 1984, the organization has responded to over 100 humanitarian crises around the world, from war-torn Syria to earthquake-stricken Haiti.**

## What does International Medical Corps do?

International Medical Corps focuses on providing lifesaving medical care, improving access to clean water and sanitation, and promoting long-term health and resilience in communities affected by crises. Here are a few of their core areas of focus:

### Emergency Response and Preparedness

When a disaster strikes, International Medical Corps is often one of the first on the ground to provide medical care, shelter, and other critical services to affected communities. The organization has extensive experience responding to emergencies such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, and conflict situations.

### Health Care

International Medical Corps works to improve health outcomes and increase access to healthcare in some of the most underserved regions of the world. Their programs include training local healthcare workers, equipping health facilities, and providing essential medicines and supplies.

Access to clean water and sanitation is often a critical challenge in communities affected by crises. International Medical Corps works to improve WASH infrastructure, provide hygiene education, and prevent the spread of waterborne diseases.
