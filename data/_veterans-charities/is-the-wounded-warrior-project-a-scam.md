## Introduction

The Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) is a nonprofit organization that supports veterans and service members who were injured in the line of duty. It was founded in 2003 and has since raised over $3 billion to help those in need. Despite its noble mission, WWP has faced scrutiny in the past and been accused of being a scam. In this article, we will examine the allegations against WWP and determine whether it is a legitimate organization or a scam.

## The Allegations

The primary allegations against WWP stem from its spending practices. In 2016, CBS News and The New York Times published articles claiming that WWP had spent excessive amounts on fundraising and staff salaries, as opposed to actually helping veterans. According to their reports, WWP had spent only 60% of its donations on program services, with the remainder going to administrative and fundraising expenses.

The articles caused a public outcry, with many people questioning whether WWP was a scam. In response, WWP released a statement defending its practices, stating that it had invested heavily in job training, mental health services, and other programs to support veterans. WWP also claimed that the reports were based on incomplete information and incorrect assumptions.

## The Investigation

Following the allegations, WWP underwent a comprehensive audit by the independent accounting firm KPMG. The audit found that WWP had spent 87% of its donations on program services, with the remaining 13% going to administrative and fundraising expenses. This is well within the recommended standard of 20% for administrative expenses. The audit also found that WWP had effective controls and systems in place to ensure that donations were used appropriately.

## Conclusion

Based on the audit findings, it seems clear that WWP is not a scam. The organization has made mistakes in the past, such as spending too much on administrative expenses. However, it has taken steps to address those issues and improve its practices. WWP has also helped thousands of veterans and their families through its programs and services. For these reasons, we believe that the allegations against WWP are unfounded, and that it is a legitimate, worthwhile organization that deserves public support.
