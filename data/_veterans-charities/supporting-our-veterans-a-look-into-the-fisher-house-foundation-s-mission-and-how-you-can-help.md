## Introduction

**The Fisher House Foundation is a charity organization established to support military and veterans' families during times of medical crisis. The organization is dedicated to providing a "home away from home" for loved ones of military members and veterans receiving medical treatment.**

## What Does Fisher House Foundation Do?

The Fisher House Foundation was established in 1990 and operates multiple Fisher Houses across the United States. A Fisher House is similar to a Ronald McDonald House, providing temporary lodging for families who have a loved one receiving medical care nearby but who cannot afford to stay in a hotel or other accommodations.

Fisher Houses are located at or near major military and VA medical centers and can accommodate up to 21 families. Each Fisher House is equipped with private bedrooms, common living areas, kitchens, laundry facilities, and more. The houses are staffed by a dedicated team of volunteers who ensure that each guest has everything they need during their stay.

In addition to providing lodging, the Fisher House Foundation also offers scholarship programs and support services to military and veteran families. These services include:

* **Hero Miles:** This program provides free frequent flyer miles to military and veteran families so they can be with their loved one during medical treatment.
* **Hotels for Heroes:** This program offers free hotel rooms for military and veteran families when Fisher Houses are full or when a Fisher House is not located nearby.
* **Scholarships:** The Fisher House Foundation offers the Scholarships for Military Children program, which provides scholarship opportunities to children of military members and veterans.
* **Family Assistance:** The Fisher House Foundation assists military and veteran families with a variety of needs, such as housing assistance, financial planning, and counseling.

The Fisher House Foundation is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, meaning that all donations are tax-deductible.
