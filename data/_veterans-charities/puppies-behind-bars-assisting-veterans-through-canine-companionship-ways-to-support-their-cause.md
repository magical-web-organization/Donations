**Puppies Behind Bars (PBB) is a non-profit organization that has been helping veterans for over 20 years. The organization's mission is to train prison inmates to raise and train service dogs, which are then provided to veterans and first responders living with disabilities. The program not only benefits veterans but also the inmates, as they learn important skills that can help them transition back into society once they are released.**

## How Puppies Behind Bars Works to Help Veterans

PBB's service dog training program is based out of six different prisons located in the state of New York and the organization works with veterans all around the United States. Inmates go through an extensive selection process before being chosen to participate in the program, which involves them completing an application, going through an interview process, and providing references.

Once selected, inmates begin their training program that teaches them how to train and care for service dogs. Through the program, inmates learn valuable skills such as patience, responsibility, and dedication. They work with the dogs for up to two years before the dogs are matched with veterans and first responders in need.

After the dogs complete their training, they are matched with veterans and first responders who need them. The dogs provide assistance with things like mobility, hearing or sight loss, and other physical disabilities. Additionally, the dogs offer emotional support which helps to improve the mental well-being of veterans who are struggling with PTSD, anxiety disorders, and other mental health conditions.
