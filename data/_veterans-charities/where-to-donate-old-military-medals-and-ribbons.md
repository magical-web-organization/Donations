Military medals and ribbons hold great value for those who have bravely served in the armed forces. These symbols of honor and courage are cherished by veterans and their families alike. However, not all veterans wish to hold on to their equipment and many want to pass them on to future generations or donate them to organizations that will preserve their memory. If you or someone you know has old military medals and ribbons they no longer want, here are some places you can consider donating them to.

## Veterans' Organizations

One of the most popular places for veterans to donate their military medals and ribbons is to various veterans' organizations. Many of these groups have programs that are dedicated to supporting their members and preserving their history. Some examples include:

- The American Legion
- Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
- Disabled American Veterans (DAV)

Donating to one of these organizations can be a great way to make sure that your old medals and ribbons are being put to good use.

## Military Museums

Military museums are another excellent place to donate your old military medals and ribbons. Many museums are dedicated to preserving the history of the armed forces and the sacrifices made by soldiers. They often have special exhibits about military uniforms, equipment, and medals. Contact your local military museum or check online for a list of museums that accept donations.

## Family Members

If you have family members who are currently serving or have served in the military, they may be interested in receiving old military medals and ribbons as an heirloom. This can be a great way to keep the memories of your military service alive within your family. It's also a wonderful way to honor the sacrifices made by your family members who have served.

## Local Schools

Many schools have ROTC programs or history classes that focus on the military. Donating your old military medals and ribbons to a school can be a great way to teach young people about the sacrifices and accomplishments of veterans. Contact local schools to see if they have a program that would be interested in receiving a donation of military memorabilia.

## Conclusion

There are many places where you can donate your old military medals and ribbons. Veterans' organizations, military museums, family members, and local schools are just a few of the options available. By donating your military memorabilia, you can help preserve the history and honor the sacrifices of those who have bravely served our country.
