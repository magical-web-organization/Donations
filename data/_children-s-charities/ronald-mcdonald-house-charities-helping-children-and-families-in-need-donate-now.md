## What Does Ronald McDonald House Charities Do to Help Children?

**Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC) is an international organization that aims to provide accommodation and support for families whose children are receiving medical treatment. They provide a "home away from home" for families to stay together, which research has shown helps children recover faster.**

RMHC also funds programs to improve the health and well-being of children. These programs include **providing grants for medical research, offering scholarships to students pursuing health-related degrees, and supporting community outreach programs.**

## How Does Ronald McDonald House Charities Do It?

RMHC operates through a network of local chapters and programs, which provide services to families in need.

The **cornerstone of their work is the Ronald McDonald House program,** which provides temporary accommodation to families of seriously ill children who are receiving treatment at nearby hospitals. These houses offer a comfortable and supportive environment, with amenities such as private bedrooms, communal living spaces, and kitchens.

In addition to the Ronald McDonald House program, **RMHC also operates Ronald McDonald Family Rooms**, which are smaller versions of the houses located within hospitals. These rooms provide a place for families to rest and recharge without having to leave the hospital.

Finally, RMHC operates Ronald McDonald Care Mobiles, which are mobile clinics that provide medical care and resources to underserved communities. These mobile clinics offer services such as dental exams, immunizations, and education on healthy living.
