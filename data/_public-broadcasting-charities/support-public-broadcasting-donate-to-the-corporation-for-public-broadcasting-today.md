**The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is a non-profit organization created by the U.S. Congress to promote public broadcasting in the United States. CPB provides funding and support for a wide range of public media services, including television and radio stations, digital content producers, and community-based organizations.**

## What Does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Do?

The CPB works to ensure that the American public has access to high-quality and diverse programming on public media outlets. The corporation provides funding to local public media stations, which are responsible for creating programming that is relevant and engaging to the local communities they serve.

In addition to funding local stations, CPB also supports the development of new programming and digital content. This includes funding for documentaries and other educational programs, as well as initiatives that explore new ways to engage audiences online and through social media.

CPB also works to ensure that public media outlets are accessible to all Americans, regardless of their income, location, or other factors. The corporation provides grants to support efforts to expand access to public media, particularly in underserved or rural areas.

## How Does the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Do It?

The CPB provides funding to public media outlets through a range of programs and initiatives. These include:

* **The Community Service Grant Program:** Provides funding to more than 1,500 public radio and television stations across the country.
* **The Digital Innovation Fund:** Supports the development of new digital content and services, including podcasts, video series, and social media initiatives.
* **The Ready to Learn Program:** Funds educational programming and resources for children, particularly those from low-income families.
* **The Public Media Landscape Analysis:** Studies the public media landscape to better understand the needs and priorities of local communities.

In addition to providing funding, CPB also works closely with public media stations and other partners to develop new strategies and initiatives that can help strengthen the public media system.
