**Free Speech TV is a nonprofit media organization that aims to amplify progressive voices and promote social justice, peace, and environmental sustainability through independent media. Established in 1995, Free Speech TV has been a pioneer in public interest media and a leading advocate for free speech and independent journalism.**

## Advancing Public Broadcasting Issues

Free Speech TV serves as a voice for communities that are underrepresented or marginalized in mainstream media, such as people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and low-income populations. The organization produces and broadcasts a diverse range of content, including news, documentaries, interviews, and podcasts, that address social, political, and environmental issues from a progressive perspective.

Free Speech TV also supports other independent media outlets and grassroots organizations that share its mission of advancing media democracy and social justice. The organization partners with local community media centers, public access TV stations, and alternative media producers to provide a platform for independent voices and foster a more diverse and democratic media landscape.

## How Free Speech TV Does It

Free Speech TV relies on the support of its viewers and donors to carry out its mission and produce high-quality, independent media content. The organization's programming is available to watch online, on satellite TV, and on various streaming platforms, including Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire.

To ensure its content remains free and accessible to all, Free Speech TV does not accept any funding from corporate or government sources. Instead, the organization depends on individual donations from its supporters, as well as grants and sponsorships from like-minded foundations and organizations.
