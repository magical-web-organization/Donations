**Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is a non-profit corporation dedicated to providing quality television broadcasting services to the American public. Founded in 1969, PBS has become one of the largest and most respected television networks in the world, with a viewership of millions of people.**

## What Does PBS Do to Help with Public Broadcasting Issues?

The primary goal of PBS is to promote education, culture and the arts through its programming. The network is committed to providing a diverse range of programming that educates, informs and inspires the audience. PBS offers programs in various genres, including news, documentaries, drama, comedy, music and the arts. Moreover, PBS not only has broadcast stations, but also digital platforms and apps that are used by millions of people worldwide.

PBS is an organization that is funded primarily by donations from viewers and corporate supporters. The network's annual budget of more than $2 billion is used to fund the production, acquisition and promotion of its shows. Without donations from viewers like you, PBS would not be able to provide the quality programming that the American public has come to love and rely on.

## How Does PBS Do It?

PBS strives to maintain a high standard of quality that can be seen in its programming. The network employs a team of experts who are responsible for selecting and producing programs that meet the standards of educational and informational value. Moreover, PBS is committed to being a trusted source of news and information for the American public, as its flagship programs like NewsHour provide in-depth reporting on the most pressing issues of the day.

PBS also collaborates with a wide range of partners, including educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and government agencies to create programs that promote public understanding of important topics. The network also offers workshops, online tools and resources that help teachers across the country integrate its programming into their classrooms.
