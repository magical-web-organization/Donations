Homelessness is a pervasive problem, and it is especially devastating for young people, who may have no resources and no one to turn to for support. Covenant House is a charity that provides shelter, care, and support for homeless and at-risk youth, helping them rebuild their lives and find a path to a brighter future.

## What is Covenant House?

**Covenant House is a nonprofit organization that operates in over 30 cities in the United States, Canada, and Latin America. The charity was founded in 1972 by Father Bruce Ritter, a Catholic priest who was moved by the plight of homeless youth in Times Square, New York City. Today, Covenant House serves over 80,000 young people every year, providing shelter, food, clothing, medical care, counseling, and education to help them escape the cycle of homelessness and poverty.**

## How Does Covenant House Work?

Covenant House provides a wide range of services to young people to help them get back on their feet. The charity's programs can be tailored to meet the specific needs of each individual youth, but they generally include:

1. **Emergency Shelter:** Covenant House provides immediate shelter to homeless youth who have nowhere else to turn. Young people can stay at a Covenant House shelter for up to 90 days while they receive a wide range of services and support.
2. **Long-Term Housing:** For youth who need more comprehensive support, Covenant House offers longer-term housing options. These programs provide young people with up to 18 months of housing and support as they work to rebuild their lives.
3. **Basic Needs:** Covenant House provides young people with basic needs, including food, clothing, and medical care. The charity also helps young people access legal services and transportation, as well as other support services they may need.
4. **Education and Employment:** Covenant House works to help young people achieve their education and employment goals. The charity offers general education services, GED preparation, and vocational training programs.
