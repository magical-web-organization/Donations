**The YWCA is a global organization whose main objective is to promote gender equality and empower women while eliminating racism. The YWCA's role in combating homelessness is crucial and has been acknowledged worldwide. The organization has put in place various measures to combat this social problem.**

## How the YWCA Helps with Homelessness

### Housing Programs

The YWCA has set up several housing programs to help people who are homeless or at high risk of becoming homeless. These programs have various structures, including emergency shelters, transitional housing, and permanent supportive housing. Emergency shelters provide short term housing, while transitional housing is for those who need temporary accommodations to get back on their feet. Permanent supportive housing provides long-term rental assistance to people with special needs who have experienced chronic homelessness.

### Support Services

The YWCA provides essential support services such as case management, counseling, and job training to help people transition from homelessness to permanent housing. The organization recognizes that housing alone is not enough to combat homelessness, and that's why they offer these services to address the underlying issues that lead to homelessness.

### Advocacy

The YWCA advocates for policy changes aimed at ending homelessness. The organization lobbies for increased funding for affordable housing, homelessness prevention, and vital support services.
