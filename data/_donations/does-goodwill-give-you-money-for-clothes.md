If you have a pile of gently-used clothing that you no longer need, you may be wondering if you can turn your clothes into cash by donating them to Goodwill. Many people believe that Goodwill will pay them for their donated clothes, but is this actually true?

In this article, we'll explore whether or not Goodwill gives you money for your clothes, and provide some alternative options for selling your gently-used items.

## Does Goodwill Pay for Clothes?

The short answer is no, Goodwill does not pay individuals for donated clothing. When you donate your clothes to Goodwill, you are giving them away for free in the hopes that someone else will buy them. Goodwill then uses the money generated from sales to fund their charitable programs and support their operations.

While it would be nice to get paid for our unwanted clothing, it's important to remember that donating to Goodwill is still a great way to give back to our communities and support individuals in need.

## What to Do with Gently-Used Clothing?

If you're looking to make some extra cash from your gently-used clothing, there are several alternative options available:

### Consignment Stores

Consignment stores such as Plato's Closet, Buffalo Exchange, and Crossroads Trading Co. will pay you for your gently-used clothing. These stores typically only accept items that are in good condition and are on-trend. You'll receive a percentage of the sale price of your items once they sell.

### Online Resale Platforms

There are several online resale platforms such as Poshmark, ThredUp, and Depop that allow you to sell your clothing online. These platforms are easy to use and allow you to set your own prices. However, you'll need to factor in shipping costs and platform fees when determining your profit.

### Yard Sale

If you have a large amount of gently-used clothing to sell, consider hosting a yard sale. You can set your own prices and keep all of the profits. Just be sure to advertise your sale ahead of time to attract buyers.

## Conclusion

In summary, Goodwill does not pay individuals for their donated clothing. However, there are several alternative options available for those looking to make some extra cash from their gently-used items. Consider consignment stores, online resale platforms, or hosting a yard sale to turn your old clothes into cash.
