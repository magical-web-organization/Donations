Donating a car to charity can be a great way to give back and help a good cause. Not only does it free up space in your garage, it also gives you an opportunity to potentially benefit from a tax write off. However, the question remains - who gets the tax write off for a donated car?

## Who can claim the tax write off?

First and foremost, it's important to note that not everyone is eligible to claim a tax write off for a donated car. Only taxpayers who itemize their deductions on their tax return will be able to claim the charitable contribution deduction.

Additionally, in order to qualify for the tax deduction, you must donate the car to a qualified charitable organization. This means that the organization must be recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a 501(c)(3) organization.

## How much can you deduct?

The amount that you can deduct for a donated car is based on the fair market value of the vehicle. The fair market value is the price that the car would sell for on the open market. If the car is worth less than $500, you can deduct the fair market value of the vehicle up to $500. If the car is worth more than $500, you can only deduct the actual sale price of the vehicle.

## How is the deduction claimed?

The charitable contribution deduction for a donated car is reported on Schedule A (Form 1040) under the "Gifts to Charity" section of your tax return. If the donated car is worth $5,000 or more, you will also need to complete Section B of Form 8283 - Noncash Charitable Contributions.

## Conclusion

In summary, the taxpayer who donates the car to a qualified charitable organization is the one who is eligible to claim the tax write off. The amount that can be deducted is based on the fair market value of the vehicle, and the deduction is reported on Schedule A (Form 1040). Donating a car to charity can be a great way to give back, so it's important to understand the tax implications of such a donation.
