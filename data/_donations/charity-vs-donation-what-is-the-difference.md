original: What is difference between charity and donation?
---
In the world we live in today, most people use almost synonymous terms such as charity and donation as if they mean the same thing. However, donating and giving charity are two different concepts that have their meanings and purposes. In this article, we will discuss the difference between charity and donation.

## What is a Donation?

A donation refers to an act of giving something such as money, food, clothes, or any other item that someone needs. The donation is voluntary and may be given by an individual, organization, government, or a business entity. 

The donation usually serves a specific purpose such as supporting a cause, helping the less fortunate, or helping victims of natural disasters. The act of donating can be a one-time event or a regular contribution to a beneficiary.

## What is Charity?

Charity, on the other hand, is providing assistance, support, or an approach in dealing with societal problems such as poverty, illness, or any other issue affecting a group of people or society as a whole. Charity can be in the form of money, goods, knowledge, time or anything that can help address the root cause of the problem.

Charity organizations aim to create solutions to problems through awareness campaigns, education programs, and other initiatives that help eradicate a problem through, for example, providing healthcare or education to the needy.

## Differences between Charity and Donation

One can donate without necessarily engaging in charity work, but one cannot engage in charity work without donating resources. The key differences between the two can be summarized into the following:

### The Purpose

The primary purpose of donations is to provide immediate relief and support to those in need, while charity aims to address the root cause of a problem and offer sustainable solutions.

### The Beneficiaries

Donations usually benefit an individual or needy family, whereas charity organizations seek to help a group of people or society as a whole.

### The Approach

Donating is a one-off transactional act with no long-term involvement, while charity work requires a long-term commitment to help bring change and address societal problems.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while the two terms (donation and charity) have similar concepts, they are distinct terms with different functions and purposes. Donating money or resources is a good start, but charity work goes beyond just giving â€“ it helps address the root cause of a problem and provides lasting solutions. Both charity and donation are noble and impactful acts that do a great deal to improve society.
