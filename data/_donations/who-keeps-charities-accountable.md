Charities are organizations that exist for the purpose of doing good in the world. Whether they focus on humanitarian aid, environmental protection, or something else entirely, their ultimate goal is to make a positive impact on society. But with so many charities out there, how can we be sure that all of them are doing what they say they will do? Who is responsible for holding charities accountable?

## The IRS

One of the primary actors responsible for ensuring that charities are operating legally and transparently is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Charities must meet certain requirements in order to attain and maintain their tax-exempt status, including an annual filing of IRS Form 990, which provides information on the organization's finances and activities.

The IRS can levy fines or revoke an organization's tax-exempt status if they are found to be in violation of these requirements. This serves as a powerful incentive for charities to operate in accordance with the law and in the best interests of their donors and the public.

## State Attorneys General

Each state has an Attorney General who has the authority to investigate and prosecute cases of fraud or other wrongdoing by charities operating within their state. They can also require charities to submit reports or make other disclosures in order to ensure that they are operating in a transparent and ethical manner.

In recent years, state Attorneys General have been instrumental in holding large charities accountable in high-profile cases. For example, the New York Attorney General's investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation resulted in a $2 million settlement and the dissolution of the organization.

## Board Members and Donors

Charities are also held accountable by their own board members, who are responsible for overseeing the organization's activities and ensuring that it is staying true to its mission and values. Board members can be held liable for damages caused by the organization's actions, so they have a vested interest in making sure that everything is above board.

Likewise, donors have the power to hold charities accountable by choosing to give their money only to organizations that they believe are acting in the best interests of their cause. Donors can also demand transparency and accountability from charities they support by asking to see financial reports or other documentation.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are several actors responsible for holding charities accountable and ensuring that they are using their funds in accordance with their stated mission and goals. From the IRS to state Attorneys General, from board members to concerned donors, a wide range of people and organizations are working to ensure that charities are operating in a transparent and ethical manner. By working together, we can create a world where charities are held accountable and can make a true impact on society.
