---
As charitable organizations aim to do good globally by using donations for humanitarian and social welfare activities, it is essential that the funds received are put to productive and effective use. However, some charities do not efficiently use donations, which can lead to wastage and distrust in the organizations. In this article, we will explore some of the charities that inefficiently use their donations, and the reasons for their inefficient use.

## Reasons for inefficiency

Before jumping into the charities that have been recognized for their inefficient use of donations, it is necessary to understand why these charities fail to use the funds efficiently. Some of the reasons for inefficiency include:

* Weak financial management
* Ethical misconduct
* Lack of transparency
* Poor organizational structure
* Inadequate governance

## Charities that inefficiently use their donations

### 1\. Wounded Warrior Project

Wounded Warrior Project is an organization that focuses on providing aid to veterans with disabilities. It has been recognized for its inefficient use of donations, with reports of excessive expenses on events, travel, and employee salaries instead of programs intended to benefit disabled veterans. The charity has since worked to improve its financial management, but it remains a controversial organization in terms of expense allocation.

### 2\. Kids Wish Network

Kids Wish Network is a charity that fulfills the wishes of children with life-threatening illnesses. However, it has been targeted for its high fundraising and administrative expenses, with accusations of soliciting donations intended for sick children and using them for other purposes. Audit reports reveal that this organization spends less than 3% of its funding on helping children, making it one of the least efficient charities.

### 3\. Cancer Fund of America

Cancer Fund of America is a charity that supports cancer patients, but was sued by the Federal Trade Commission for fraudulent fundraising practices. The charity allegedly used telemarketers to solicit donations, but only a mere 2.4% of the funds raised actually went towards helping cancer patients. The charity was eventually forced to shut down and pay damages for its fraudulent practices.

## Conclusion

While some charities may have good intentions, it is essential that they use donations efficiently and transparently to maximize their impact on society. High administrative expenses or fraudulent practices not only waste the donations but also discourage potential donors from contributing. Therefore, before donating to a charity, it is crucial to do proper research and check their track record to ensure your donations are being put to good use.
