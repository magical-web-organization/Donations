If you are looking to clear out some clutter from your home and you have items you would like to donate, Goodwill may be one of the first organizations that come to mind. However, sometimes you may not have the means to deliver your items to a local Goodwill store. So, the question then arises: Does Goodwill do home pickups?

## The Short Answer

Yes, Goodwill does pickups from your home or place of business, as long as your location is within their designated pickup service area.

## The Details

Donating to Goodwill not only helps you declutter your home, but it also helps support their mission to provide job training and employment services to people in your community. If you are unable to drop off your items at a local Goodwill store, they do offer a free pickup service to make the process easier for you.

To schedule a pickup, simply visit the Goodwill website and enter your zip code to see if your location falls within their pickup service area. If it does, you can then proceed to schedule the pickup by providing some basic information about yourself and the items you wish to donate.

It is important to note that Goodwill only accepts items that are in good, usable condition. This means that items should be in working condition and free from any rips, stains, or tears. They also do not accept certain items, such as mattresses or hazardous materials.

## Conclusion

In summary, if you have items you would like to donate but cannot make it to a local Goodwill store, they do offer a pickup service within their designated service area. This service is free and easy to schedule via their website. Remember to only donate items that are in good, usable condition and do not fall under their list of restricted items. Happy donating!
