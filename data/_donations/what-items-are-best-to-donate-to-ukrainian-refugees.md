original: What items are best to donate to Ukrainian refugees?
---
The ongoing war in Ukraine has displaced thousands of people, leaving them in need of basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. As the international community continues to work towards finding a solution to this crisis, individuals can also make a difference by donating to Ukrainian refugees. However, it can be difficult to determine what items are most needed and valuable. Here are some suggestions on what to donate to Ukrainian refugees in need.

## Clothing

Many Ukrainian refugees have fled their homes with little more than the clothes on their backs. Clothing donations can be valuable, especially items that are practical and suitable for the climate. Warm jackets, hats, scarves, and gloves are especially important during the winter months when temperatures can drop to sub-zero levels. Additionally, clothes need to be clean, in good condition, and appropriate for all ages and genders. Donating used clothing is an excellent way to support Ukrainian refugees, but please ensure it is wearable and free of damage.

## Non-perishable food items

Food is a universal necessity, and Ukrainian refugees are in need of non-perishable food items. Canned goods, rice, pasta, flour, sugar, and other dry goods are the best things to donate. Donors should avoid perishable items and pre-packaged foods that may contain allergens that refugees are not accustomed to eating.

## Medical Supplies

Because of the conditions experienced by refugees, they need medical care on a regular basis. You can provide medical assistance through the donation of medicine and medical supplies. Items like pain relievers, antihistamines, antibacterial medicines, multivitamins, and eyeglasses will be highly appreciated. However, when donating medicine, it should be verified that it meets the standards set by the health board.

## Bedding

Many Ukrainian refugees have been forced to flee their homes in the middle of the night, and therefore have not had time to gather the essentials for daily life. Donating bedding materials such as linens, blankets, pillows, and sleeping bags can help provide warmth and comfort to these brave survivors.

## Cash

Finally, monetary donations are the most effective way to provide help to refugees. Rather than donating physical items or food, monetary donations give organizations the flexibility to purchase precisely what is required. They can then obtain necessities like food, medicine, and supplies in bulk at lower prices. Many organizations help Ukrainian refugees and offer a simple online donation platform where you can help support their efforts.

Donating to Ukrainian refugees in need is crucial in times of hardship. Before making your donations, you should research some trustworthy organizations that meet their demands, like the Red Cross. If you are in doubt, try to reach out to other volunteers and activists to discover the most efficient way to support refugees. Though the situation may seem overwhelming, small acts can make a big impact, and simple donations can help to ease a refugee's path.
